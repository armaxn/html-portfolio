<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Myself Arman Pathan <br>
  I'm currently pursuing Engineering Degree in computer science with specialization in Atifitial Intelligence & Machine Learning <br>
</p>

<p>I have some knowledge of web development as I have seen some of the lectures earlier but left in the middle <br>
But now I am planning to complete the whole course as I am focusing on myself. This portfolio website is just a basic website I will create much more good looking website in the future.</p>

<p>I am also learning Python language. I have completed most of it but it will take 1 week to complete whole. <br>
After that I will learn Django and Machine Learning and SQL. This is because I am pursuing degree in AIML so i need to know all of this because it will be helpful for me in the future</p>

<p>That's it from my side. See you soon!</p>
